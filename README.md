# OpenStack Database Exporter

This is a Prometheus exporter that aims to pull some of the data that is
provided by the [OpenStack Exporter](https://github.com/openstack-exporter/openstack-exporter)
but directly from the database.

## Why?

The existance of this exporter is an OpenStack bug.  At scale, the APIs
become extremely sluggish at operating with large number of API requests.

In addition, certain queries can be done far more effectively directly
without going through many different API calls.  The goal of this exporter
is to be operator-facing and providing high performance for large scale
clouds.
